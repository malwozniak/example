    "description": "Just set it up, turn it on, and brew. There you have it! Rich-tasting coffee expertly brewed for you without the fuss. Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause is a lifesaver when you need a cup before the brew cycle is finished. It stops brewing so you can pour a rich-tasting cup and then finishes the brewing cycle after you place the carafe back in position. We put our best brewing forward with this easy-to-use, Simple Brew coffee maker. Experience the taste with the Mr. Coffee brand."
